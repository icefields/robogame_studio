/**
 * Android devices are rarely powerful enough to maintain 60fps indefinitely. 
 * The CPU will be burdened with incoming messages, internal changes, and much more.
 * That means that the frame rate will fluctuate.To prevent movement speed from 
 * depending on frame rate, we use this deltaTime variable to check how much time 
 * elapsed since the last update. If the update took twice as long (i.e. frame rate was halved), 
 * then deltatime would be doubled. We multiply this deltaTime throughout our game's 
 * update methods to ensure that no matter what the frame rate is, our character 
 * will move by the same amount given the same time period.
 * Of course, this means that our speed could go from 1 pixel per second to 10 
 * pixels per second. If we have a thin wall, this sudden increase in deltaTime could
 * mean that our collision detection system will break. That is why we cap the deltaTime 
 * (it is capped at 3.15 in the above example) so that if the game slows down too much, 
 * then we will let movement depend on frame rate so that we do not break our entire game 
 * trying to maintain consistent movement. This is prioritization at work.
